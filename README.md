# Excel-Project
Built a comprehensive sales dashboard leveraging advanced Excel functions, including XLOOKUP, pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charts, to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights. The dashboard integrates multiple data sources, enabling seamless data consolidation and real-time analysis. Using XLOOKUP, data relationships were established across datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency, while pivot tables allowed for flexible summarization of sales performance by product, region, and time period.
Applied data cleaning techniques to address inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues, ensuring a high-quality foundation for analysis. Incorporated advanced date formatting, conditional logic, and calculated metrics to enable trend analysis, performance tracking, and forecasting. Created interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, and timelines, allowing stakeholders to explore data dynamically and identify patterns.
Designed the dashboard to be intuitive and user-friendly, incorporating slicers and filters that empowered users to customize views and drill down into specific datasets without additional technical expertise. Delivered clear documentation and a data model structure to support ongoing use and adaptation. This project enhanced decision-making capabilities, streamlined reporting processes, and provided stakeholders with a powerful analytical tool to guide strategic planning and optimize business performance.
